\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\textsc{Docker Swarm} is implemented in Go, but it offers multiple bindings for other programming languages.
We fully implement \GP in the Ruby programming language (v2.3.1).
In particular, we based our code on gem \emph{docker-api}~\cite{docker-api}, a lightweight Ruby binding for the \textsc{Docker Remote} API, using \textsc{Docker} API (v1.16)~\cite{docker-remote}, compliant with the one used by \textsc{Docker Swarm}(v1.22).
The scheduler orchestrates the containers by leveraging \textsc{Resque}~\cite{resque}, a \textsc{Redis}-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs.

In our evaluation, we map containers to jobs and rely on a \textsc{Resque}-based scheduler to timely deploy them over the \textsc{Docker Swarm}.
\GP is released as open-source and is freely available at \testbedrepo.
