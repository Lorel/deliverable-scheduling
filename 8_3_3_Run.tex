\subsection{Run \GP{}}
\label{subsec:genpacksetup:run}

We are assuming that your \textsc{Docker Swarm} manager, the \textsc{Docker} daemon from your manager host, the servers \textsc{Redis} and \textsc{InfluxDB} are all reachable from where you are launching \GP{}.
Typically, \GP{} is launched on the \textsc{Docker Swarm} manager host, but you can also launch it remotely if each service is reachable from thre (you can eventually open some SSH tunnels for that).

Once all the requirements described above are checked, run \GP{} from the root of its code directory with the command:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small]
$ bundle exec rake genpack:init
\end{lstlisting}

Then you can follow \GP{}'s logs from the file \texttt{log/genpack.log}.

You can now run some containers when it is explained at the beginning of this chapter~\ref{chap:usermanual}.
